# ELIPPSS

ELIPPSS web portal is a web application developed in the scope of the Unmanned Aerial Systems course at the [Institute for Geoinformatics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/) in 2018. In groups the students applied various monitoring and exploratory approaches to assess the environment at the study area, a segment of the Aa river just west of MÃ¼nster, Germany. The technologies applied range from unmanned aerial vehicles ([drones](https://www.microdrones.com/en/)) to terrestrial [LiDAR](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scanse/sweep-scanning-lidar) to [senseBox](https://www.sensebox.de/) in-situ ground stations.
ELIPPSS is a mostly open source project that provides access to the data produced in the field. It includes a simple WebGIS interactive map, where users can toggle between the raster and vector data produced by some of the project groups.
