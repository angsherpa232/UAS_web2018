      <p>Welcome to <strong>ELIPSS</strong>. This web portal provides visualization and processing tools for data created during the Unmanned Aerial Systems class in spring 2018, held at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/">Institute for Geoinformatics</a>        in the University of Münster. The course was held by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/OekologischePlanung/en/team/lehmann.html">Professor Jan Lehmann</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVVgeo/dieivv/mitarbeiter/prinz.html">Professor Torsten Prinz</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/institute/staff/index.php/55/Sergey_Mukhametov">Professor Sergey Mukhametov</a>.</p>

        <h1>Renaturating the Aa River</h1>
        <p>Greater awareness and actions has been developed in recent decades by trans-national governmental institutions from national to local level, intending to perform renaturation of rivers under the European Union water policies entitled: EU Water
          Framework Directive (WFD) with “good quantitative status” and “good chemical status” of all rivers until 2023. <br> Major challenges that rivers and lakes in European cities face are grouped into: water availability and supply challenges, water
          quality issues, structural changes to and physical modifications of rivers and lakes (EU, 2016). <br> <br> Major challenges that rivers and lakes in European cities face are grouped into: water availability and supply challenges, water quality
          issues, structural changes to and physical modifications of rivers and lakes (EU, 2016). The Aa river located in the South of Münster, in the year 2008, has undergone a process of renaturation by the municipal government. In order to restore
          to the natural form of this river. <br> <br>
          Therefore, perform monitoring and exploratory approaches to assess the effects on vegetation and hydromorphological quality such as river bank structure, river continuity and/ or substrate of the river bed, turned out to be a suitable and assertive opportunity to gain knowledge with the application of geospatial technologies to practical contexts.
